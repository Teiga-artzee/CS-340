How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

Writing a program that is mainatainable means to comment your work clearly, thoughtfully,
and in blocks of comments at the beginning to give an overview, while small snippets are used
for greater detail. It helps to inform what is being done, and the reason behind that.
Defending the design process helps cement the need for that written portion of code.
Code that is readable helps not only maintain the code, add to it, but also allows others to
come in and understand what is being done. Making code readable means following coding format
guidelines set forth from your company, teacher, or language.
Adapatable code was accomplished by making the code flexible and not so dependant on one
specific feature that if swapped out for something else, would break it entirely. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What were the advantages of working in this way? 

Working with a program that was readable as I came back to the project each week meant that I could 
understand what had been done previously as everything was named descriptively,
the code was spaced appropriately, and everything made logical sense.
Maintable code reminded me of what a specific aspect of code was doing from the blocks of comments
to the short and quick ones. It was not difficult to figure out what I was doing from the other day or
week, and others could come in and do the same.
Adapatable code meant I could add on to it as the project grew, knowing I wasn't breaking another portion
of the already working and tested code of the application.

How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I could use this module in full stack development, or when I need to provide statistical analysis from
any database and data I have access to, whether for work or future school projects.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 

Approaching a problem as a computer science means to think critically about a problem.
Writing out the problem and what the customer wants to be the solution, helps to illistrate a road map
that I should follow as I begin designing the application at hand. Thinking logically through each
step make sure that the process flows smoothly and that it makes sense how things work.
You also have to approach the application in the eyes of the customer, and how they would want it to function for
them. They are not computer scientists, and what would be a natural decision or understanding of how something should
work, I need not assume they would think the same. Design and implimentation are vital as well as
how straightforward the mechanics of the application are to any given user.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 

Generally speaking, my approach was very similar to other courses. I created a bare bones outline 
of what the application was going to be, and then begin filling in and adding features and design.
However, unlike other projects, using dash in Jupyter allowed for more of a flexibility with
adding and taking away these features than other programs had in the past.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Diversity in how the data is displayed by adding further graphs of different data types.
flexibility in how the user can interact with the data which would allow them to
adjust what parts of data they find important as this can change due to business demands. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer science, the science of computations, doesn't exactly explain what a computer scientist does, however
a computer scientist has a wide range of job responsibilities. They must gather requirements and specs from their customer,
create a prelimanary design and often create a prototype to present to the customer for approval. Then they create a road map and set 
a timetable to fully research, develop, test, polish, and ship the product out for production.
In all of this, they have to consider the user when creating the product as well as those who would later become mainters of this code.
They must think logically about each process, and must code securely to prevent the application from failing or breaking because it
had not been properly tested and maintained.
